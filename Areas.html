<h1>Areas, Maps, Terrain & Weather</h1>
<p>Places mentioned in H2C: </p>
<h2>Areas & Maps</h2>
<h3>Enroth</h3>
<p>Almost as large as Antagaritch, but slightly smaller & less diverse. Fully north of the equator, but
   Dragonsands/Mire of the Damned (most will need name changes) close to equator. Rather than having 15 square maps
   of equalish size, each section will have its own outdoor map of varying size based on the area.</p>
<h3>Antagaritch</h3>
<p>Very large, most diverse geographically, equator runs thru Eeofol, Tularea & the top of Deyja. Nighon close to
   mainland but large, separate island with its own geography (think Madagascar a bit). Evenmorn off the southwest
   coast, closest to Tatalia. Krewlod separates Tatalia from Bracada but also touches Erathia. Contested Lands
   (Harmondale) on the Avlee/Erathia border, but close-ish to Deyja as well, kinda kitty-cornered. Barrow Downs part
   of Krewlod, may need a rework (not dwarves in there or full of ghosts/gogs). Swap Tularea to be the northern section
   of Avlee (the place that's called Avlee in MM7C) & make Pierpont in Avlee proper.</p>
<h3>Jadame</h3>
<p>Smallest of the 3, includes Regna kind of because it's the closest, but Regna is in reality its own separate
   entity. Mostly northish of the equator, which should run right through Dagger Wound & above Regna.</p>
<h4>Murmurwoods</h4>
<h4>Alvar</h4>
<h4>Ironsand Desert</h4>
<h4>Garrote Gorge</h4>
<h4>Ravenshore</h4>

<h2>Terrain & Weather</h2>
<h3>Terrain</h3>
<p>Each area should have a base terrain or two from among the possibles that correlates with the character of the
   area & the associated castles. e.g. Tatalia is mostly Swamp in the lowlands, but a bit of rough in the high hills.</p>
<p>In TBS, fighting on native terrain gives +1atk/def/spd like in H3C, but does not reveal landmines or quicksand.
   Also, having all creatures native to the terrain negates any movement penalty if there is one, and grants bonus
   movespeed if there isn't.</p>
<h4>Types of Terrain</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Grassland - 0% move penalty</li>
  <li>Forest - 10% penalty</li>
  <li>Dirt - 0% penalty</li>
  <li>Rough - </li>
  <li>Savannah - 10% penalty</li>
  <li>Sand - 50% penalty</li>
  <li>Swamp - 50% penalty</li>
  <li>Lava - 25% penalty</li>
  <li>Subterranean - 10% penalty</li>
</ul>
<h3>Weather</h3>
<p>Weather consists of rain, snow, wind & extreme heat, each is seasonal, locked in to certain months/days of a
   year, and varies per area of the map you're on.</p>
