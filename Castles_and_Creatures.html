<h1>Castle Design & Creature Factionaliy</h1>
<h2>Castle General</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Hall will scale as Village Hall - Town Hall - City Hall - Metropolis Center. Capitol will be special upgrade for
			known, named places (e.g. Steadwick).</li>
	<li>Town Hall will visually add fountain (necessary for town portal). City Hall will grow bigger, Metropolis
			should be biggest & multi-level on all types. Capitol should either be a custom image or more ornate version of
			Metropolis in same style (e.g. for Castle, lots of ornate, gilded accents. for Inferno, more glowy brimstone)
			.</li>
	<li>Town requires only Tavern still, City should require basic Mage Guild, Blacksmith (which will be a single
			combined building representing arms & armor sales/repair/etc., to be cohesive with MM), and Marketplace
			(which will be a set of shops representing alchemist, magician & bank, to be cohesive with MM). Metropolis
			requires Castle still.</li>
	<li>Upgrading to Metropolis should upgrade the troops garrisoned in the towers. In towns with 2+ troops (Castle,
			Tower, Stronghold, Conflux, Necropolis & Dungeon), just replace the lowest shooter with the highest one (e.g.
			Orcs -> Cyclopses) & double the damage. In Rampart, Elves -> Grand Elves and consequently shoot twice. In
			Fortress, 2 more wall garrisons (for a total of 4) + a 2nd Lizard Archer in the keep for double damage. <s>In
			Inferno, Gogs -> Magogs improving damage to 1.5x & giving 1 hex fireball ring.</s></li>
	<li>Technical: allow for disabling certain structures while enabling the rest of the tech tree to be built.
			Essentially, allow e.g. a Mage Guild to be bypassed for a magic-less scenario (think Dragon Slayer map 4) but
			still allow for a City Hall to be built.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Mage Guild</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Levels are now Basic - Advanced - Expert - Master (no 5th) instead of 1-5</li>
	<li>Visually, should be a set of 3 buildings (elemental/self/lifedeath), each of which "grow" per level, and a
			well in the middle (for spell point restoration).</li>
	<li>Each castle should have an "affiliation" with a certain type of magic that's cohesive with the heroes & the
			overall theme. Maybe e.g. Castle has a bonus to body & spirit, like those guilds have 1 level higher spells
			than the actual built guild level or something.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Castle Defense Structures</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Fort adds basic walls with 1hp each</li>
	<li>Citadel adds keep (2hp) & gives drawbridge 2hp</li>
	<li>Castle adds outer towers (2hp) & makes all walls 2hp + keep 3hp</li>
	<li>Fortification (common bldg, H2C import) makes all walls & towers 3hp. Makes Citadel Keep 3hp (does not make
			Castle Keep 4hp)</li>
</ul>
