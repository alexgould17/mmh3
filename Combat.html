<h1>Combat Mechanics, RPG & TBS Combined</h1>
<h2>Role-Playing Game Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Attack Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Overall, attacking should be much like MMClassic, with a few exceptions: arrow attacks should do more damage
      thru a combo of might/accuracy effect, buff spells & new hit system (below); and, magic-heavy/exclusive
      classes should be able to cast a spell as a ranged attack thru a staff or wand.</li>
  <li>Staff/wand attack: casts the basic DD spell of a selected magic school at the target, reduced sp cost as
      follows: Bas - 20%/Adv - 30%/Exp - 50%/Mas - 75%/GM - 100%. Must know magic school to use that type of atk.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hit Rate & Bonus Mechanics</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Overall, the hitrate should revolve around a critical-like system of 5 possible hits: very weak, weak, average,
      strong & very strong.</li>
  <li>Tentative names: Glancing Blow, Weak Hit, Average Hit, Critical Hit, Slayer Strike</li>
  <li>Default damage modifiers: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0</li>
  <li>Armor Class & Hit Bonus should revolve almost entirely around modifying the chances of which of the 5 occurs,
      and/or the damage modifiers, rather than manipulation of the underlying damage formula. Same goes for Magic
      Resistances.</li>
  <li>For physical attacks, the calculation should be calculated based on the ratio of attacker's Hit Bonus with
      the defender's AC, on a -4 to +4 scale. Tentatively, -4 means AC 400% greater than Hit Bonus, -3 means AC
      300% greater than Hit Bonus, +4 means Hit Bonus 400% greater than AC, etc. At 0, all 5 hit possibilities are
      open. At +1, worst possibility disappears & chances grow for better ones. At +2, the next weakest possibility
      disappears leaving Average as the worst-case scenario, with Critical being the most likely. At +3, Average is
      totally ruled out, leaving only Critical or Slayer Strike as options, on a sliding scale that tilts towards
      Slayer the further towards +4. At +4 & above, Slayer Strike is guaranteed. The reverse happens with symmetrical
      chances for negative values.</li>
  <li>The hit modifier should be multiplicative & occur after the weapon damage is calculated, along with any
      ele weakness/armor skill/etc. modifiers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Turn-Based Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>All combat mechanics such as turn structure, speed calculations, etc. should be copied wholesale from classic except
   where noted.</p>
<h3>Morale</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Same -3 to +3 scale as H3C generally (GM Leadership opens up +4, GM Demoralize opens up -4), but two positive
      & 2 negative outcomes, rather than just 1 of each. Also, Master Leadership/Demoralization effects cancel out,
      but GM effects override Master.</li>
  <li>Positive: Minor - 50% extra movement hexes for the unit this turn or 50% bonus atk spd if extra movement unused.
      Rolls for & is triggered at unit turn start, indicated in info box with some indication (e.g. [7]) that
      distinguishes the one-turn nature of the effect. Major - Extra full turn of movement/atk for the unit. Only diff
      between this & classic H3 is the indication of the roll at the start of the unit's turn.</li>
  <li>Negative: Minor - 50% reduced movement hexes of 50% reduced atk spd for the turn. Same indication/roll as
      Positive outcomes. Major - Fully lost turn like H3C.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Luck</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Like Morale, same +-3 scale as H3C except for GM Luck/Intimidation giving +-4, but positive & negative
      outcomes follow the same 5-outcome system as the RPG. Also, Master Luck/Intimidation effects cancel out,
      but GM effects override Master.</li>
  <li>The Luck Factor that determines what outcome occurs is based on the attacking unit's luck minus the defending
      unit's luck. Possible ranges are from -8 to +8: 0 means every hit is an Average Hit. +1 opens up possibility of
      Critical. +3 opens up possibility of Slayer. +5 guarantees Critical, +7 guarantees Slayer, +8 increases Slayer
      mod by 100%. The reverse is symmetrically true.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ranged Units</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Ranged attacks should suffer a distance penalty (e.g. -25% dmg for firing >10 hexes away), and additionally
      shooting over castle walls should downgrade a hit one category (e.g. an Average Hit should become a Weak Hit)
      unless skills prevent it. (TBS) Ranged attacks should suffer a distance penalty & also have a max distance
      travelled before completely petering out & the missile disappearing, even spells. I think -50% here for long
      range is ok since there aren't really castle walls to fire over (RPG).</li>
</ul>
