<h1>Unified Crafting, Repair & Enchanting System Mechanics</h1>
<p>In general, we don't want players to be making things (excluding potions). We want them to take already-made
   suits of armor, weapons, etc. and repair them, upgrade them with rarer components & set their preferred
   enchantments on them. For now, this will mostly focus on the RPG side of things, as I don't think crafting in
   general is a mechanic I'd want to add to the TBS, though eventually the relics & artifacts should be cohesive
   between the two.</p>
<p>In MMC, the repair was a very binary system: things were either broken or not, and you could either fix them with
   a single button press mid-battle with no materials, or you couldn't fix them at all unless you paid someone to do
   it. I think a 0-100 scale of broken-to-working perfectly would be better, as well as needing a dedicated place to
   repair things along with some raw materials (see materials section), somewhat similar to how Fallout manages
   repairs (4 would be the prime example here).</p>
<h2>Armor & Weapons</h2>
<h3>Armor</h3>
<p>Rather than having the breast/chest be considered the "armor" from a skill standpoint & everything else be
   wearable no matter what, all armor will be divided into 4 different bodyparts: head (helmet, hat, etc.), core
   (breastplate, leather chestpiece, etc.), arms (gauntlets & gloves), and legs (boots). Arms & legs always in pairs.
   Further, each equipment  item shall fall into one of the 3 armor categories (leather, chain, plate), and the
   associated skill will be required to equip them (this will be partially mitigated by every chara having an armor
   skill by design, even dodging classes, see skill section for more detail). Also, materials will be required to
   repair any significant damage in armor: specifically, the leather(s)/metal(s) the armor is made of. Leather core
   pieces will be equippable underneath chain/plate core pieces for added protection & recovery penalty.</p>
<p>Each piece of armor will be able to have 0-3 enchantments based on the repair status & the material quality of
   the base armor, and each enchantment will fall into 1 of 3 categories: damage reduction, regeneration & special.
   Damage reduction enchantments will bolster the AC or magic resistance of the wearer, regeneration will boost
   the hp or sp regen of the wearer, and special covers anything else.</p>
<h3>Weapons</h3>
<p>Weapons, like armor, will generally not be forged wholesale from ores but rather obtained in made fashion & then
   repaired & enchanted by the player. Like armor, each weapon will be able to carry 0-3 enchantments based on the
   underlying quality of the weapon & its repair status (e.g. think starting longsword from MM8C can carry 0, but
   Archangel Broadsword can carry 3). Weapon enchantments will fall into 3 categories: magical damage, skill &
   special. Magical damage (non-magic weapons only, i.e. excludes staves/wands) will add a bonus magical damage in
   the selected school of magic. Skill will increase the weapon skill (non-magic weapons) or magic school skill
   (magic weapons) of the wielder. Special is reserved for things like swift, lifedrain, etc. Enchantments should all
   be hot swappable if costing a bit of resources to redo.</p>
<h2>Wands & Staves</h2>
<p>Wands & Staves should be used in place of any other weapon for All-Magic classes (i.e. they should be barred from
   wielding any other weapons) & should be available to be used as weapons (providing ranged magic damage in a school
   known to the wielder at the cost of small amounts of sp per attack) for any class with magical prowess (i.e.
   All-Might heroes are barred from it, even ones like Paladin that can opt to learn magic, but all others can use if
   desired) .</p>
<p>3 basic components: Bulk material (wood, metal, etc.; helps channel the magic, different materials offer different
   effects for attacks), magical core (top-tier alchemical reagent, elemental shard, etc.; helps provide the power,
   each one has a different effect.), and focusing lens (gem or glass, provides directed output for attacks. this
   part is optional for the most basic of staves, e.g. the wooden staff from MM7C, but those will not provide any
   ability to channel magical attacks, they are simply blunt objects to hit people with, e.g. for a monk). Unlike
   weapons & armor, these will be able to be (& encouraged to be) built from scratch, probably as part of the
   "promotion" quest to the particular class/job. The bulk material & magical core should not be able to be hot
   swappable, though the bulk material should be able to be salvaged to some degree when scrapping an old/broken
   item, but the focusing lens should be hot swappable. e.g. you build a basic wooden staff with a phoenix feather
   core & zircon lens, but then later find a diamond, you can pop the zircon out & put the diamond in for no cost
   except the gem.</p>
