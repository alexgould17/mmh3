<h2>Role-Playing Game Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Primary Stats</h3>
<h4>Thresholds</h4>
<p>Soft floor is 0, soft ceiling is 500. Anything above that is padding against temp reduction. General Thresholds
   for learning/upgrading skills: Basic - 20 stat / Advanced - 30 stat & 4 lvl / Expert - 50 stat & 7 lvl /
   Master - 150 (main) or 100 (aux) stat & 10 lvl / Grandmaster - 250 (main) or 150 (aux) stat & 15 lvl.</p>

<ul>

<h2>Secondary Skills</h2>
<ul>
  <li>In general, any secondary skill can be learned by any class & is only restricted by stats, with a few
      exceptions (e.g. Necromancers can't learn Life Magic)</li>
  <li>Rather than basing derived stats (like hp & sp) and their growth on chosen class, they should be managed
      almost exclusively thru primary stats, with those growing accordingly. A notable exception would be spell
      effects, e.g. temporary hit rate reduction due to being cursed.</li>
  <li>Races should have small but noticeable effects on primary stats at character creation but should taper off in
      favor of chosen path-based growth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Turn-Based Game Mechanics</h2>
<h3>Primary Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Attack (largely works the same as H3C)</li>
  <li>Defense (largely works the same as H3C)</li>
  <li>Spell Power (largely works the same as H3C)</li>
  <li>Knowledge (somewhat different)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Secondary Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Will now scale as Basic - Advanced - Expert - Master - Grandmaster to be cohesive with RPG</li>
  <li>Basic must be learned at a castle in the appropriate building, at an adventure map scholar (think H3C Witch Hut)
      or can be spec'd into on-the-fly if hero's home castle/specialty allows it (there will be some lore about the hero
      travelling with scholars to fulfill this).</li>
  <li>Battle skills get learned at Blacksmith, Magic skills get learned at Mage Guilds & Other get learned at
      Marketplace.</li>
  <li>No more RNG-based secondary skills. Experience, level & primary skills (Atk/Def for Battle, Pwr/Knw for
      Magic) will determine how many secondary skills & to what proficiency a hero can learn.</li>
  <li>Generally, Grandmastery of skills should not be able to be learned from the castle, but from an outside
      scholar. Each castle should have 1-2 available, thematically appropriate, once a Metropolis is built.</li>
  <li>Level 1 Heroes should start with 3 skills thematically appropriate to their type, e.g. Death Knights should
      have Death Magic along with 2 battle skills.</li>
</ul>

      survive a lethal hit 1 time per round; Grandmaster - 30% all incoming damage reduction. Last creature of any
      level will survive a lethal hit once per round. Example: gnolls have 5hp per unit. if they take a 13 damage
      hit, normally 2 will die. Master/GM Armorer will allow only 1 to die from that 1 hit (unless it's the last of
      a stack & enough damage was done to kill a theoretical extra in the stack, so e.g. a stack of only 2 gnolls
      won't survive 15 or more damage)</li>
