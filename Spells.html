<h1>All Spells & Their Effects</h1>
<p>A quick note that there is great intent to not only synchronize which spells are in which schools of magic across
   all games, but also to provide similar effects & learn at similar levels across all games.</p>
<p>Each of the 9 schools has 12 spells: 5 Basic (2 free, 1 DD 1 other), 4 Advanced (1 free), 3 Expert (1 free) & 2
   Master (1 free). Each level has free spells that must be paid for on a per-character/per-hero basis in both RPG &
   TBS. Each spell gets stronger with advancing levels/expertise in the skill.</p>
<p>Damage for DD spells will be divided into categories, with two parts: A base number, and a range potential,
   to provide for some differentiation between elements. Mechanically, I think the spell dmg calculator method
   should accept these effectively as an integer (for base) & a float (for range), but have the standard values be
   specifically enumerated. For range specifically, it will be a float >0 & <=1, with 1 meaning no range (it just
   does the base damage no matter what), and the closer you get to 0, the greater the possible variance, with the top
   end being 1/range * base. So e.g. a range of 0.5 would give you from 50% to 200% of the base value, with
   relatively equal chance of being any int value in that range. So with a base of 10, you would get a total damage
   of anywhere between 5-20. For base, the enumerations (pending specific values) should be: Trivial, Weak, Medium,
   Strong, Massive & Overwhelming. For range, the enumerations should be: None (1.0), Narrow (0.9), Medium (0.75) &
   Wide (0.6). Range should be rolled once per instance.</p>
<p>Cooldowns should also work like the damage, in that an integer is accepted, but standard enumerations are
   provided & expected to be used for most spells. Standard enums: Minimal, Short, Standard, Long, Very Long,
   Enormous.</p>
<p>Cast cost as well I think should have standard enumerations but flexibility in allowing any realistic non-negative
   int value to be input. Standard enums: None (0) Minimal, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, Gigantic, Tremendous.</p>
<p>Magic resistance slides on a scale from -100% to 100%, hardcapped on both ends. 100% <em>resistance</em> is a +4
   to defense on the combat scale (gt'd glancing blow), -100% is -4 to defense. 75% +3 etc. Immunities will be
   exceedingly rare & coded separately, but nullify all damage of a particular type.</p>
