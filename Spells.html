<h1>All Spells & Their Effects</h1>
<p>A quick note that there is great intent to not only synchronize which spells are in which schools of magic across
   all games, but also to provide similar effects & learn at similar levels across all games.</p>
<p>Each of the 9 schools has 11 spells: 4 Basic, 3 Advanced, 3 Expert & 1 Master. Each level has a free spell, and 3
   that must be paid for on a per-character/per-hero basis. Master spell comes free with Master tuition. Each spell
   gets stronger with advancing levels/expertise in the skill.</p>
<p>Magic resistance slides on a scale from -100% to 100%, hardcapped on both ends. 100% <em>resistance</em> is a +4
   to defense on the combat scale (gt'd glancing blow), -100% is -4 to defense. 75% +3 etc. Immunities will be
   exceedingly rare & coded separately, but nullify all damage of a particular type.</p>
