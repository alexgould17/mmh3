<h1>Status Conditions & Their Effects</h1>
<h2>Table of Status Conditions</h2>
<p>Considering taking out "Sanity" condition altogether for Sanism reasons. Fear & Pacification may be enough for mind
   already.</p>
<p>Chances of inflicting a status are rolled on a per-event basis unless a more serious status than can be inflicted
   already exists on the receiving party. Rolling a status of the same level that's already been inflicted refreshes
   the duration. % chances are meant to be cumulative out of a total of 100%. So e.g. if creature A has a 20/30/50%
   chance of inflicting Poison1/2/3 for 3 turns on an attack, then it is guaranteed to inflict a poison status
   (20+30+50==100%). If Creature B already has Poison2 with 1 turn left, then there's a 50% chance nothing will
   happen (rolling Poison1 will neither override nor refresh the duration of Poison2), 30% chance of Creature B
   having its Poison2 status extended to last 3 more turns (Poison2 roll refreshes duration), and a 20% chance
   Creature B will be upgraded to Poison3 for 3 turns (TBS example).</p>
