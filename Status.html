<h1>Status Conditions & Their Effects</h1>
<h2>Table of Status Conditions</h2>
<p>Chances of inflicting a status are rolled on a per-event basis unless a more serious status than can be inflicted
   already exists on the receiving party. Rolling a status of the same level that's already been inflicted refreshes
   the duration. % chances are rolled separately, starting with the highest possible status. So e.g. if creature A
   has a 100/40/20% chance of inflicting Poison1/2/3 for 3 turns on an attack, then Poison3 gets rolled first. If the
   20% chance doesn't hit, Poison2 will be rolled. If that 40% chance doesn't hit, Poison1 will be guaranteed to
   succeed. If Creature B already has Poison2 with 1 turn left, then there's a 20% chance Creature B will be upgraded
   to Poison3 for 3 turns, a 32% chance (40% of the remaining 80%) of Poison2 being refreshed for 3 turns & 48%
   chance (100% - 32% - 20%) of nothing happening (Poison1 will neither refresh the duration of, nor override
   (TBS example) .</p>
<p>Additionally, resistance/weakness to the element associated with a status will lower/increase the chance of
   receiving that status from an enemy attack, with immunity to an element preventing it entirely (e.g. an Air
   Elemental, which has immunity to Air damage, is also immune to all forms of Shock, because it is associated with
   Air).</p>
